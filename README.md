# BridgeAuth
Secure centralized authentication platform for Minecraft: Pocket Edition. Powered by Twitter and the EPICMC BridgeAuth API.

*In order to authenticate in-game:* your players will need to visit https://bridge.epicmc.us in their web browser and login using their Twitter account. This helps prevent impersonation.

Then they generate a 4 digit bridge token which is used as a password to login in-game.
